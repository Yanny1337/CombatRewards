Set rewards for PVE or PVP & punishments upon death (+Player-Heads)!


Each hostile mob now has customizable price values for their reward in the config file.

This plugin rewards for pvp and hostile mobs, not for neutral or friendly entities.

Works great to keep players with keepInventory from voiding for free and to reward farming mobs.
With default settings, player-heads drop after PVP with their name, the date, and time on its item tag.

Economy-based plugin made for bukkit / spigot / paper Minecraft servers.

Requires: Minecraft v1.16.x, Vault, EssentialsX.
